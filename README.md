# Matching Summaries

## Overview
This repository contains supplementary tables for the study "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Online Learning Platforms Using Embedded Quasi-Experiments in Real-World Settings". These tables provide summaries of balance before and after matching, which was conducted using the MatchIt package in R [1]. Matching was performed to balance the 'on-topic' and 'off-topic' groups based on three selected covariates: 'practiceBefore', 'practiceDuring', and 'practiceDays'. The purpose of this repository is to enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the results presented in the study.
